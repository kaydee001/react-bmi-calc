# BMI Calculator - React

A simple React application to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) using useState and useEffect hooks. Users can input their height and weight, and the app will live convert these values into BMI along with the corresponding category type (e.g., Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obese).
